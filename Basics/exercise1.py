# Below you can see a student_grades list. Your task is to use Python to count how many items with a value of 10.0 are in the student_grades list. 
# Once you find the proper list method that counts items, then print out its output using a print() function.
student_grades = [5.6, 6.9, 'olu', 10.0, 4, 7, 5.5, 8.9, 'Cat', 10.0]
# print(student_grades.count(10.0))

# in username into lowercase letters and prints out the output.
